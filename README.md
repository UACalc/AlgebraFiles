UACalc AlgebraFiles
===================

Finite universal algebras can be described using XML tags understood by the
[Universal Algebra Calculator](http://uacalc.org).  This repository contains
many examples of such files.

## Releases and citations
Citing files in this repository in publications requires some care because
the contents of this repository change often. Nonetheless, it is possible to create accurate
citations that point to files that existed at some point in time (but might no longer exist in the
master branch). This is accomplished using [releases](https://help.github.com/categories/releases/) and [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

## Adding new algebra files

If you would like to add your own algebra (.ua) files to this repository so you can safely cite them in
publications, you can either

(1) submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

   OR

(2) email your algebra files to [Ralph Freese](mailto:ralph@math.hawaii.edu) or
[William DeMeo](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com).

After you do (1) or (2), a new release and a corresponding BibTeX entry will be generated.
