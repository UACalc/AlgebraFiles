Some UACalc files associated with commutative idempotent binar research.

The OverAlgebraD2.ua file is an expansion of the algebra in bergmanD2.ua.
The universe is constructed from 3 isomorphic copies of the original CIB
with universes

B_0 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 8}

B_1 = {0, 9, 10, ..., 16}

B_2 = {17, 18, 2, 19, ..., 24}

that intersect as shown in the following diagram:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 16| 15| 14|   | 24| 23| 22|
| 13| 12| 11|   | 21| 20| 19|
| 10|  9|  0|  1|  2| 18| 17|
|   |   |  3|  4|  5|   |   |
|   |   |  6|  7|  8|   |   |

The algebra has universe A = B\_0 U B\_1 U B\_2.
